# DeepVisualization

Some interesting visualization demos using Caffe and Matlab. 

 - FaceVis

  Visualize the face memorized by a face recognition model.

 - FilterVis

  Visualize the mid-level features learned by a CNN model.

 - Inceptionism
 
  Visualize the classifier neurons in a CNN model.

 - NNComplexity
 
  Show how complex the neural network can achieve, w.r.t. width, depth and structure.

 - NeuralArt

  Yet another re-implementation for paper
> A Neural Algorthm of Artistic Style' by Leon Gatys, Alexander Ecker, and Matthias Bethge (http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).

 - PrototxtGen
 
  Some modules used to generate a prototxt for Caffe.
