Visualization for the mid-level filters in any network.

This is the codes for reproducing the results in my paper, Visualizing Deep Neural Network by Alternately Image Blurring and Deblurring 
(arxiv link comming soon).

The codes are not well organized and need some specail skills to tune the hyper-paramters, 
such as learning rate and the gaussian std of the blur kernel.
I am attempting to reduce the parameters or find a way to automatically set them.
